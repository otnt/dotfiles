# Dotfiles

A dotfile collection for useful tools with awesome configuration, including vim, tmux, git etc.

Also have install script for programming language (python, node, js, java etc), useful tools (mongodb etc).

# Install

### **Recommended way:**

The recommended way is using docker.

First install docker using [this script](https://github.com/otnt/dotfiles/blob/master/install/docker.sh).

Then install any tool you want. See usage helper under different [docker folder](https://github.com/otnt/dotfiles/tree/master/docker).

### **Install directly:**

Alteratively, you could install the tools directly using bash script.

The scripts could be found [here](https://github.com/otnt/dotfiles/tree/master/install).

**Notice**, usually you need to run the script in `sudo` mode. 

**Also Notice**, you may need to replace variables like `$USERNAME`, `$USERHOME` in the scripts. That's why docker way is recommended.
